<!-- REQUIREMENTS
Use grid or flex.
Use three various types of CSS units.
Make sure it works on all screen sizes. Some people will not be able to attend the gallery but they have a virtual gallery room.
Desktop: 1680 x 1050
iPad: 1024 x 768
Mobile: 480 x 320
You must use z-index and hierarchical selectors in the code.
Use common shorthand where applicable.
Add an HTML form to collect the names and emails of interested visitors. 
It should have a submit button and the form's action will take the user to another HTML page.
Note: the form does not actually need to collect information! You can direct the user to another HTML page by assigning a value to the <form>'s action attribute. -->
